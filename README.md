# Blackjack Game in Python

## Description:
This is a simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. The game allows a player to play against an automated dealer. The game follows standard Blackjack rules, and it includes features like betting, hitting, standing, and recognizing Aces that can be worth 1 or 11.

## Modules and Variables:
- **Modules**: The game utilizes Python's `random` module for shuffling the deck.
- **Variables**: 
  - `suits`: A tuple containing the four card suits.
  - `ranks`: A tuple containing the ranks of cards.
  - `values`: A dictionary mapping card ranks to their respective values in the game.
  - `playing`: A boolean variable that controls the game loop.

## Classes:
1. **Card**: Represents a playing card. Each card has a suit and rank.
2. **Deck**: Represents a deck of playing cards. Provides methods to shuffle the deck and deal cards.
3. **Hand**: Represents a hand of cards held by the player or dealer. This class can add cards to the hand, calculate the value of the hand, and adjust for Aces.
4. **Chips**: Keeps track of a player's starting chips, bets, and ongoing total.

## Functions:
The game includes functions for:
- Betting (`take_bet`)
- Drawing a card from the deck to a hand (`hit`)
- Asking the player if they want to hit or stand (`hit_or_stand`)
- Displaying cards, with the dealer's first card hidden (`show_some`)
- Displaying all cards (`show_all`)
- Determining game outcomes like win, lose, or tie.

## Gameplay:
On starting the game:
1. The player is welcomed to the game.
2. A deck of cards is created and shuffled.
3. Two cards each are dealt to the player and the dealer.
4. The player is asked to place a bet.
5. The initial cards are displayed, with one of the dealer's cards hidden.
6. The player is prompted to hit or stand.
7. The game continues until the player chooses to stand or the player's hand value exceeds 21.
8. If the player's hand value is 21 or less, the dealer draws cards until the dealer's hand value is 17 or more.
9. The winner is determined based on the hand values of the player and dealer.
10. The player is given an option to play another round or exit the game.

## How to Run:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Download the Code**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine. Alternatively, download the Python script (`blackjack.py` or whatever you've named it) to a directory of your choice.

3. **Run the Game**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and execute the following command:
   ```
   python blackjack.py
   ```
   This will start the game, and you can follow the on-screen prompts to play.
